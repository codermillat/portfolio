# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
This portfolio and blog exist to bridge the gap between advanced AI/EdTech research and the real-world needs of students, developers, and educators in resource-constrained environments, especially in South Asia.

## Problems It Solves
- Lack of culturally relevant, practical AI and EdTech content for developing countries.
- Scarcity of guides addressing infrastructure limitations (budget, internet, power).
- Limited access to ethical, research-backed perspectives on AI in education and society.
- Underrepresentation of South Asian voices and experiences in global tech discourse.

## How It Should Work
- Articles combine technical depth with personal narrative and actionable steps.
- Content is accessible, SEO-optimized, and available in multiple languages.
- Automated integration ensures new articles are indexed and discoverable.
- Responsive, accessible design for all devices and users.

## User Experience Goals
- Empower users with practical, step-by-step guides and real-world stories.
- Foster a sense of community and representation for underrepresented groups.
- Establish trust and authority through transparency, research, and open-source contributions.
- Provide a seamless, engaging, and inclusive reading experience.
