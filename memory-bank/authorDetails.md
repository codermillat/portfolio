## Biography / Summary

I'm Millat, a passionate and curious Computer Science undergraduate at Sharda University (Greater Noida, India), originally from Bangladesh. My academic journey began in August 2022, and I'm on track to graduate in 2026. I am deeply interested in emerging technologies, research, and innovation—especially those that have a positive global impact.

My current research centers around fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using parameter-efficient techniques such as LoRA and 4-bit quantization. I focus on real-world applications, particularly AI-powered solutions for study abroad consultation and educational guidance. I am the creator of the StudyAbroadGPT-Dataset and have led projects involving Mistral-7B-Instruct, Gemini Pro API, FAISS, and RAG-based architectures.

Beyond research, I have practical experience in full-stack web development, Android app deployment, SEO/content creation, and social media management. I have worked with Study International Admission Care (SIAC), IRD Sharda University, and led YouTube-based content strategies. I am also an active participant in coding challenges on LeetCode.

My long-term goal is to pursue graduate studies abroad and contribute to ethical, accessible tech innovations at the intersection of AI, education, and social equity.
