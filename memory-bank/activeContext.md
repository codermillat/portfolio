# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Initializing the Memory Bank documentation for the portfolio and blog project.
- Ensuring all core context files are created and accurately reflect the project's goals and current state.

## Recent Changes
- Created projectbrief.md with a summary of project goals and scope.
- Created productContext.md outlining the purpose, problems solved, and user experience goals.

## Next Steps
- Complete the initialization of systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, and progress.md.
- Keep Memory Bank updated as new features, articles, or architectural changes are made.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Emphasize cultural context, accessibility, and technical rigor in all documentation.
- Maintain a clear separation between project goals, product context, technical patterns, and progress tracking.
- Use the Memory Bank as the single source of truth for ongoing and future development.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Documentation-first workflow: update Memory Bank before and after significant changes.
- Modular, maintainable codebase with a focus on DRY and SOLID principles.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Unique positioning comes from blending technical depth with personal and cultural narrative.
- Automated content integration and SEO are critical for discoverability and impact.
