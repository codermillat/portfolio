# From Bangladesh to India: My Journey as an International Student and AI Researcher

Every journey begins with a single step, but mine began with a question: "What if I could help other students avoid the confusion and challenges I faced when moving from Bangladesh to India for higher education?" This question, born from my own experience, eventually led me to develop StudyAbroadGPT—an AI system designed to guide international students through their educational journey. But let me start from the beginning.

## The Beginning: Growing Up in Rural Bangladesh

### Early Years in Dinajpur

I was born on June 10, 2003, in Dinajpur, a district in northern Bangladesh known for its agricultural heritage and traditional values. Growing up in a rural setting, I was surrounded by the simple beauty of village life—rice fields stretching to the horizon, the sound of traditional music during festivals, and the warmth of a close-knit community.

My parents, like many in our village, valued education as the key to a better future. They worked hard to provide me with opportunities they never had. My father, a farmer, and my mother, a homemaker, instilled in me the importance of hard work, perseverance, and the belief that education could open doors to unimaginable possibilities.

### The Spark of Curiosity

From an early age, I was fascinated by technology. While other children played with traditional toys, I was drawn to anything electronic. I remember taking apart old radios (much to my parents' dismay) just to see how they worked. This curiosity wasn't just about understanding machines—it was about understanding how things could be made better, more efficient, more useful.

My formal education began at Raghobendropur Primary School, where I excelled in mathematics and science. These subjects came naturally to me, not because I was particularly gifted, but because I found joy in solving problems and understanding how the world worked.

### Academic Journey in Bangladesh

My educational path took me through Binodnagar High School, where I completed my secondary education. The curriculum was rigorous, focusing heavily on science and mathematics—subjects that would later become the foundation of my work in computer science and artificial intelligence.

At Aftabgonj Govt College, I pursued my Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) in the science stream from 2019 to 2021. This period was crucial in shaping my academic interests and preparing me for higher education. The challenges I faced—limited resources, outdated textbooks, and a competitive environment—taught me resilience and the importance of self-directed learning.

## The Decision: Moving to India

### Why India?

The decision to study in India wasn't made lightly. It involved months of research, discussions with family, and careful consideration of various factors. India offered several advantages:
