# Entrepreneurship in Tech: Lessons from Building CodestBD Inc. and the Premium VPN App

Every entrepreneur's journey is unique, but the lessons learned are universal. My path from founding CodestBD Inc. to building a successful Premium VPN app taught me invaluable lessons about entrepreneurship, technical development, and business growth. This is the story of how a 17-year-old student from Bangladesh built a tech company that would eventually be sold, and the real lessons learned along the way.

## The Beginning: From Student to Entrepreneur

### The Spark of Entrepreneurship

In May 2020, at the age of 17, I founded CodestBD Inc. with a simple mission: to create technology solutions that serve the Bangladeshi market. The decision to start a company wasn't driven by a desire for wealth or fameâ€”it was born from a genuine passion for technology and a belief that I could create solutions that would help people.

At the time, I was still a student, balancing my academic responsibilities with the demands of running a startup. This dual role taught me my first important lesson: entrepreneurship requires incredible time management and the ability to wear multiple hats.

### Why Start a Tech Company?

The decision to start a tech company was influenced by several factors:

- **Market Opportunity**: Bangladesh's tech sector was growing rapidly, creating opportunities for innovative solutions
- **Personal Interest**: My passion for technology and programming made it a natural choice
- **Local Focus**: I wanted to create solutions specifically tailored to the Bangladeshi market
- **Learning Opportunity**: Entrepreneurship offered a chance to apply my technical skills in a real-world context

## The Premium VPN App: From Idea to Reality

### Identifying the Market Need

The idea for the Premium VPN app emerged from a simple observation: many people in Bangladesh needed reliable, secure internet access, but existing solutions were either too expensive, too slow, or too complicated to use.

I conducted market research and discovered:
