## Brief overview
These guidelines define the standards and workflow for creating, maintaining, and integrating new articles into the personal blog (millat.tech/blog) and the associated portfolio project. They ensure consistency, discoverability, and alignment with the author's established presence and memory bank.

## Article content and structure
- Each article must have a clear, descriptive title and a concise summary/abstract at the top.
- Articles should be written in markdown, using headings, bullet points, and code blocks where appropriate.
- Include relevant metadata (author, date, tags/keywords) at the top or in frontmatter if supported.
- Content should be original, technically accurate, and reflect the author's expertise and voice.

## Naming conventions and file organization
- Article filenames should use lowercase, hyphen-separated words matching the main topic/title (e.g., `lora-fine-tuning-beginners-resource-constrained-ai.md`).
- All articles must be placed in the `src/articles/` directory.
- For multi-part series, use a consistent prefix or numbering (e.g., `ai-ethics-part-1.md`, `ai-ethics-part-2.md`).

## Integration and discoverability
- Every new article must be added to the canonical blog index at [millat.tech/blog](https://www.millat.tech/blog) and cross-referenced in `memory-bank/internetPresence.md`.
- Update the blog/article list in the memory bank with the new article's title, summary, and direct link.
- Ensure the article is discoverable via the portfolio's blog UI (BlogPage, BlogPostPage, etc.).

## Technical and stylistic guidelines
- Use clear, accessible language, but do not oversimplify technical concepts.
- Include code snippets, diagrams, or screenshots where they add value.
- Use internal links to reference related articles or projects when relevant.
- Proofread for grammar, clarity, and technical accuracy before publishing.

## Maintenance and updates
- If an article is updated or revised, update the "Last updated" date in both the article and the memory bank.
- Deprecated or superseded articles should be clearly marked as such, with links to newer content.
- Regularly review the blog and memory bank to ensure all articles are current and accurately indexed.

## Other guidelines
- All articles should align with the author's research focus, project themes, and personal branding as outlined in `authorDetails.md`.
- For collaborative or guest articles, clearly indicate authorship and maintain the same standards.
- When in doubt, prioritize clarity, transparency, and value to the reader.
