# Adding Articles to the Blog

This guide explains how to add new articles to the portfolio blog system.

## Current Articles

The blog currently contains these articles:

├── building-studyabroadgpt-ai-educational-guidance.md
├── lora-fine-tuning-beginners-resource-constrained-ai.md
├── future-ai-education-personalized-learning.md
├── edupath-ai-platform-research-to-product.md

## How to Add a New Article

### 1. Create the Markdown File

Create a new `.md` file in the `src/articles/` directory with a descriptive filename:

```bash
# Example: for an article about AI in healthcare
touch src/articles/ai-healthcare-applications.md
```

### 2. Add Frontmatter

Every article needs frontmatter at the top of the file:

```markdown
---
title: "Your Article Title"
description: "Brief description for SEO (150-160 characters)"
author: "MD MILLAT HOSEN"
date: "2025-01-28"
tags: ["Tag1", "Tag2", "Tag3"]
category: "AI & Research"
featured: true
excerpt: "A short excerpt that appears in the blog listing (2-3 sentences)"
gradient: "from-blue-500 to-purple-600"
---
```

### 3. Write Your Content

Use standard Markdown syntax for your content:

```markdown
# Main Title (H1)

## Section Title (H2)

### Subsection (H3)

Your content here...

- Bullet points
- Code examples
- Links and references

## Code Examples

```python
def example_function():
    return "Hello World"
```

## Conclusion

Wrap up your article...
```

### 4. Update the Markdown Loader

Add your new article to `src/utils/markdownLoader.ts`:

```typescript
// Import your new article
const newArticleContent = await import('../articles/your-new-article.md?raw');

// Add it to the articles array
articles.push(processArticle('your-new-article-slug', newArticleContent.default));
```

### 5. Update the Sitemap

Add your article URL to `public/sitemap.xml`:

```xml
<url>
  <loc>https://www.millat.tech/blog/your-new-article-slug</loc>
  <lastmod>2025-01-28</lastmod>
  <changefreq>monthly</changefreq>
  <priority>0.7</priority>
</url>
```
